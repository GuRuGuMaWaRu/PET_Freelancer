TODOs

X ProjectForm does not load current project properly (always shows the previous project, although the true current project is inside state)
--- new currentProject is fetched after EditProject loads, so EditProject does not update when it's context data is fetched
--- when pressing Edit button project data is not loaded into the form
X Double rerendering when entering Edit Form
X CANCEL button (Project Form) not working
X Deploy to Heroku

- Replace FontAwesome inline with FontAwesome react version
